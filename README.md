machine learning

The typical application of machine learning is mainly reflected in the following aspects:

1）image recognition

2）speech recognition


Deep Learnin：

Deep learning is a new field based on machine learning, which is originated from neural network algorithm inspired by human brain 

structure and developed with the increase of model structure depth. With the improvement of big data and computing power, a series

of new algorithms are produced. At present, the voice recognition of Google, baidu image recognition and Google Image Search in Android 

phones we use have used deep learning technology. Facebook's readiness for face recognition in last year's deepface project was close 

to the human eye for the first time (97.25% vs 97.5%). In the era of big data, the impact of the development of deep learning on our 

lives in the future is immeasurable. Conservatively speaking, many of the current human activities will be replaced by machines due to

the development of deep learning and related technologies, such as autonomous vehicle driving, drones, and more functional robots. 

The development of deep learning makes us see and approach the ultimate goal of artificial intelligence for the first time.
